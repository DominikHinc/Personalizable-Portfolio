Because the application concept didn\’t come from me, I had to adapt to somebody\’s else ideas and indications. A lot of changes had to be discussed and approved for me to implement. One of the reasons it took so long to complete is the technology I made this application in. LibGDX is not optimized for creating such applications, because of that I had to create many systems, like navigation or notification system, on my own. Lastly, two months before release the whole UI was scrapped and had to be redesigned, which extended the creating process even more.'

        text:'This project truly opened a world of mobile development for me. I learned from it the basics and some more advanced stuff related to mobile development. Another important thing I learned was how to cooperate with a team bigger than myself and how to create something basing on somebody\'s else instructions and indications. I further improved my java programming skills and gained experience in working under pressure, when the release date was coming.'
