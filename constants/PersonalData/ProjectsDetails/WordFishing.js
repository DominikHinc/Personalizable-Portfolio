Because the idea didn\'t come from me I had to adapt to somebody\'s ideas and improvements. Another reason is that because LibGDX is not framework optimized to create such application I had to create many ststems, like navigation or notiffication system, on my own. Lastly, two months before to release whole UI had to be scrapped and redesigned as It wasn\'t good enough. '
